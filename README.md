# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV and MediaPipe

## Description
This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It leverages MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities to detect and recognize gestures in real time. This system can be used in applications such as touchless controls, sign language interpretation, and gaming.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- High accuracy and responsiveness using MediaPipe.
- Easy-to-use interface for live gesture detection.
- Configurable gesture definitions for custom use cases.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd hand-gesture-recognition

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

## Usage
1. Ensure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Perform gestures in front of the webcam to see real-time recognition.
4. Customize gestures by editing the configuration file (if available).

## Screenshots/Demo
